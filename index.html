				Wild pandas get a boost
			</h1>
			<br>
			<p>
				WWF protects wild pandas by preventing habitat loss caused by human development and encroachment, the most serious threat to their long-term survival. For years, led by WWF-China and now with new partners including Disneynature, we’ve worked to preserve and link important panda corridors across China, spanning more than 34 million acres, three provinces, and two of the country’s largest river basins.

				<h2>HABITAT OF THE PANDA</h2>

					The giant panda was once widespread throughout southern and eastern China, as well as neighbouring Myanmar and northern Vietnam. Most of the remaining wild pandas live in the Minshan and Qinling mountains. And it is here that WWF has focussed its giant panda conservation work, supporting the Chinese government's efforts to conserve the species.

					The mountains form a natural barrier between the densely populated southern and eastern provinces of China and the great wilderness of the Tibetan Plateau, the highest and largest in the world.

					The mountains are part of China's most critical watershed, channeling rainwater into both of the country's great rivers, the Yangtze and the Yellow. And the warm rains on the southern slopes support a rich variety of plants and animals. Along with a few hundred pandas, the mountains are also home to other endangered species, including the golden monkey, takin and crested ibis.
